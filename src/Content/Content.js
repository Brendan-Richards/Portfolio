                    <p>I've loved coding since I was young and became particularly interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence as an 
                    undergrad. Many of my academic projects involve the application of these algorithms to my current area of study. 
                    Other passions that occupy my life include progressive rock music and quantum physics.</p>
                    <p>I grew up in Colorado and love the outdoors. Much of my free time is spent running, hiking,

                    to create original melodies for music. It works by creating a set of melodies (a population), determining their worth
                    based on a pre-defined fitness metric, allowing the melodies to randomly change (mutation), creating a new population 
                    by preferentially combining high fitness melodies from the current population, and repeating this process until
                    stopping criteria are satisfied.</p>  <p>The code was written in Python and makes use of the mido library to export Midi
                    files after the algorithm has run. Some examples of music I've generated can be found
